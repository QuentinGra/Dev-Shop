# Flashy-Coder

This repository contains a project developed as part of my Web and Mobile Web Developer training program.

## 📝 About

Flashy-Coder is an educational e-commerce application structured as a monorepo, including both a REST API and a modern web front-end.

- The API is built with [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/) (Node.js).
- The front-end is developed with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) + [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

This project was created as a training exercise and is not intended for production use.
